    <h2>Segway Centaurs: Are The Future</h2>
    <img src="assets/img/centaur.jpg" alt="Picture of the Segway Centaur" width="200" height="200" class="img-center"/>

    <p>Imagine, if you will, a world without cars? Instead, you can have an all-terrain electric 4 wheeled vehicle. That is the Segway Centaur. Using state-of-the-art gryoscopic suspension, this vehicle can withstand the roughest terrain. Here at Segway Incorperated (*subsidy of Ninebot), we provide innovative solutions to transportation. Just look at this happy customer reivew:</p>

    <blockquote><p>"This Segway Centaur is great! I can take it anywere- from mountain trails to my living room! It's the perfect vehicle. I even used it as the family vehicle for summer vacation."</p></blockquote>
    <p>Bill Bob, <em>a definitely not paid out reviewer</em></p>
    <p>And there are totally thousands of 5 five star reviews for the Centaur just like that one! People just love the compact design, ease of use, and how fast it is. 0-60(km/hr) is just <em>7 seconds</em>! Charging the battery from 0 to 80% just takes <em>4 hours</em>. To all of our investors, we plan on reaching profitability by at least 2030.</p>

      </header>
      <p>We've spent several years trying to make the Centaur as comfortable and user friendly as possible. Even our base models are feature rich! Gyroscopic suspension, off road wheels, 8 hour battery life, and a comfortable seat come in all models. Additional features include cupholders, leather seating, heated seating, larger battery capacities, stereo speakers, subwoofer, and a touchscreen device.

      </header>
      <p>At Segway, we provide affordable options for almost any budget. We have several models of the Centaur, ranging from $700 to $10,000! We strive for quality and safety even on our more budget options. For parents, we even provide parental controls via our Segway app (only on Blackberry devices). This includes gps location tracking and device lock-up during specific hours of the day. The Segway App is incredibly user friendly and easy to use! All the user has to do is accept the terms and conditions and pair the Centaur(s) to the app.

        <h2> <a href="#" rel="bookmark" title="link to this post">Suspension</a></h2>
      </header>
      <p>The Segway's patented suspension returns with the Centaur. The Centaur uses gyroscopes to dynamically adjust the suspension position based on the terrain. This provides a smooth riding experience no matter how bumpy the ground is. Since the Centaur is all wheel drive, it can handle steep inclines up to 35 degrees! You can even do some seriously radical wheelies! *Segway Incorperated does not recommend users under 18 to wheelie with the Centaur.
