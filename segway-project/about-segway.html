  <p>Dean Kamen was born April 5th, 1951 in New York. He founded Segway Incorperated in the 90s. He created the iBOT, an all-terrain wheelchair, and of course, the Segway. He's won several awards, including the Heinz Award in 1999 and the National Medal of Technology in 2000. Much of his technology lives on with the Segway Centaur.</p>
  <h3>About The Company</h3>

  <p>Segway Inc. was founded by Dean Kamen in 1999. The first segway, the Segway PT, was released in 2001. The Segway HT, short for human transporter, released the following year. There were a few bugs and technical hiccups at the start of production, but those were quickly fixed with a recall. We've continued to innovate and improve our products since then. Our prices have also gone down. At launch, the Segway PT costed $5000. Now, our Segway S2, the replacement to the PT, starts at just $500! The company was bought out by Summit Strategic Investmants in 2013. Later, Segway was sold to Ninebot in 2015. We've come out with several new products since then such as scooters, go-karts, and even powerbanks. The Segway Centaur is our most recent release, with several years designing and testing the product.</p>
