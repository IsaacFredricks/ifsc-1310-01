  <h3>About The Creator</h3>

  <figcaption>Image caption</figcaption>
  <p>Dean Kamen was born April 5th, 1951 in New York. He created the iBOT, an all-terrain wheelchair, and of course, the Segway. He's won several awards, including the Heinz Award in 1999 and the National Medal of Technology in 2000. The Segway PT was his final major contribution to the company. However, his technology lives on with the Segway Centaur.</p>
  <h3>About The Company</h3>
  <p>Segway Inc. was founded by Dean Kamen in 1999. The first segway, the Segway PT, was released in 2001. After years of sluggish sales, the company was bought out by Summit Strategic Investmants in 2013. Later, Segway was sold to Ninebot in 2015. The Segway Centaur is our most recent release, with several years designing and testing the product.</p>
