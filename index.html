  <h3>Thoughts on accessability</h3>
  <p>There is a lot of things I take for granted. However, I didn't realize until a few weeks ago how important website accessability is, especially after watching the video. Things such as having a webpage be completely accessable on just a keyboard or even voice recognition for those who can't use a keyboard goes a long way. They show how they made the youtube api more accessable, and it's good to see over a decade later that youtube and other video hosting sites did add a good number of these features plus the ability to search using voice. In the vimeo link, a lot of the elements for navigating the page and controls for playing videos are also used for other sites. However, there are still a lot of websites that lack those features, or using tab goes directly to the top or side menus and not the actual main content. I had never heard of ARIA before watching, but looking at the W3C website on it I love what they are doing. It is basically a standard on how to made webpage elements and navigating sites more accessable, such making a site completely navigatable through a keyboard like I said before, or making the text size larger. Progressive enhancement (html with core content, css for presentation, javascript for behavior, and ARIA for accessability), is something I am still learning, but having everyone being able to access the same content always a good thing. Something I didn't know before was screenreaders look for ARIA roles and tags to speak. With the css background images not showing up with high contrast mode, it seems that it still hasn't been fixed from some of the articles such as <a href="https://www.levelaccess.com/blog/css-background-images-and-accessibility/">this one from Level Access</a>. It seems the only way for them to show up is to put them in html or make them inline. We learned a few weeks ago for implimenting images in html, that the alt attribute is not only for in case the image doesn't load but also if the user has a screen reader. Even for people who do not have disabilities, having these features gives them more options to navigate sites, improving the user experience for everyone. Having the content be easily readable as well as not jumping around in and between sites is also something I believe would be useful for everyone.</p>
