  <h3>Thoughts on accessability</h3>
  <p>There is a lot of things I take for granted. However, I didn't realize until a few weeks ago how important website accessability is, especially after watching the video. Things such as having a webpage be completely accessable on just a keyboard or even voice recognition for those who can't use a keyboard goes a long way. They show how they made the youtube api more accessable, and it's good to see over a decade later that youtube and other video hosting sites did add a good number of these features plus the ability to search using voice. In the vimeo link, a lot of the elements for navigating the page and controls for playing videos are also used for other sites. However, there are still a lot of websites that lack those features, or using tab goes directly to the top or side menus and not the actual main content. I had never heard of ARIA before watching, but looking at the W3C website on it I love what they are doing. It is basically a standard on how to made webpage elements and navigating sites more accessable, such making a site completely navigatable through a keyboard like I said before, or making the text size larger. Progressive enhancement (html with core content, css for presentation, javascript for behavior, and ARIA for accessability), is something I am still learning, but having everyone being able to access the same content always a good thing. Something I didn't know before was screenreaders look for ARIA roles and tags to speak. With the css background images not showing up with high contrast mode, it seems that it still hasn't been fixed from some of the articles such as <a href="https://www.levelaccess.com/blog/css-background-images-and-accessibility/">this one from Level Access</a>. It seems the only way for them to show up is to put them in html or make them inline. We learned a few weeks ago for implimenting images in html, that the alt attribute is not only for in case the image doesn't load but also if the user has a screen reader. Even for people who do not have disabilities, having these features gives them more options to navigate sites, improving the user experience for everyone. Having the content be easily readable as well as not jumping around in and between sites is also something I believe would be useful for everyone.</p>

  <h3>Segway Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
  <p>My Segway Centaur project went kind of all over the place. I knew a decent amount about html and css, I knew the requirements, and I knew it may take a long time to finish. However, I was all over the place when it came to starting it. I didn't know how much I should plan before starting, something that really made more work for me in the future. I wanted to hit the ground running, so I set up the basic file structure, added 3 different html pages, added the css, and used the example html as a starter. I got a basic idea with how I wanted my site to look-a vertical content layout with tiles seperating content. I also knew I wanted my site to have shades of blue and green. However, after that I hit a brick wall. My laptop I was using at the time was a 12 year old core 2 duo laptop that took forever to load pages and made updating the site miserable. Also, because I installed Arch linux on it with very little idea of how the file explorer worked, I did not know how to access and extract the zip file that contained the site project. That meant I would have to make up the text and image content of the site until I could figure the file issue. Coming up with said content was difficult because I really didn't want to use the provided html example since it didn't fit how I wanted my site to look. I also didn't want to use tools like Chatgpt to make up content for something I was submitting for a grade. After a few days of making up content for the site, tinkering with image placement, and tweaking the site layout, I finally figured out a way to access the project resources, which I didn't realize it also contained the text content until a few days before submission (oops). I used some of the images to really mess around with the site layout. My site broke several times because of that, but from that I learned that I can use the clear:both in css on elements that have been floated left or right. Once I found the txt file with the text content with the site, replacing the text in the site was easy. I did really want to keep that water resistance part I made, that was pure gold that I came up with.</p>
  
  <p>I felt like this project showed a lot of my weaknesses as a planner. I wanted to work on this one part of text on the site, then I realize I don't like the way it looks so I change the CSS. Then I end up constantly getting sidetracked by bugs that pop up or finishing up something I forgot about earlier. If I was going to do a type of project again in the future, I would definetly do more planning ahead of time instead of trying to get the project done. Like drawing a rough sketch of the website layout, or just trying to work on one area of the project at a time instead of tackling it all at once and end up wasting more time. I would also try not to worry so much about every piece of content when first setting up the site by using a lot of lorem ibsum and placeholder images. That way I can focus on the more important part of structuring the site. Next time, I will definetly put my text through a spell and grammar check because I didn't realize until my final draft that I mispelled "faq" with "frq." I would also next time never use a very outdated computer for schoolwork. Along with that, never use Arch Linux on a project like this, especially because of Arch Linux's completely awful file manager. I would take Windows or even Linux Mint any day of the week.</p>
  
  <p>My peer reviewer said the font text for paragraphs for text was too small, the main page title blends in too much with the background, the titles in the frq didn't stand out enough from the paragraph text, the section titles on the main page blend in too much with the background as well, I don't need to put 'posted by Isaac Fredricks' under every part, add a back to top button to the other pages, and add more space to the different sections of the main page. I did add all of those things, but asking for feedback on a project like this is not a common thing for me to do. I wasn't sure what to ask them at first other than "is there anything I can improve with the site?" After their initial response, I figured out what to ask them like readability, backgrounds, image size and placement. It was a lot of back and forth messaging with my friend on what I could improve with the site. I'm glad I got to experience recieving feedback for a project like this. It'll certainly not be the last time I'll have to do it.</p>

  <p>This has certainly been an one of my favorite tech classes I've been in. I am a hands on learner who likes to go in-person but likes having the option to have class virtually, so this class was great in that regard. I also liked how the assignments were set up. Instead of having a test for every single subject and memorizing every term, we read up on the topics, have an open discussion in class and get to work hands on for what we learned. Very rarely do we do assignments outside of class and never was it something we never talked about before. For example, when I was learning about flexbox, we talked about it briefly during class and then had an assignment with flexbox froggy. Even though we didn't learn every single flexbox css attribute at the time, I enjoyed how the assignment eased us into the subject, let us mess around with the different attributes, and let us solve each problem in our own way. Assignment deadlines were generous which allowed me to learn at my own pace and gave me enough time to learn the subject. For example, in the CSS demo, I technically got done a few days early but I spent the last few days trying to make it as wierd looking as possible and changing how every element. If I couldn't make it look good, I tried making it look as bad as possible.</p>

  <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>

  <p>Compared to Graceful Degredation, Progressive Enhancement seems like a much better way of designing/maintaining sites for older browsers. Users shouldn't have a buggier, worse experience just because they are on an older browser. Basically, Progressive Enhancement is having the html as the main content, css for the style, and javascript for the interactivity, menaing every user can experience the same content, even if their browser doesn't support newer technologies. Like what they said in the article, if the browser doesn't support javascript, the site should still work if they used progressive enhancement. It's kind of like the css image example from a few weeks ago. If the css image doesn't load or a screen reader can't read it, there should be text that shows up to replace the image. I think this is a smart way of designing a site and goes back to the accessability video we watched earlier in the semester. Every person should get equal access to content, and alterier options helps all of us.</p>
